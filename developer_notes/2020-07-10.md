Fix on_moved and on_created locally with dev.yml. Done.

Solve the PEM file error. Done. Aligned the file names in docker-compose.dev.yml.

```
Command 'openssl rsautl -encrypt -inkey /app/encrypt.pub.pem -pubin -in /output/key.bin -out /output/evidently_20200710-222915_key.bin.enc' returned non-zero exit status 1.
```

Publish the fixes the docker HUB.

Update the sftp_rsa private key to match a user that 1. exists and 2. is in the evidently_env file.

Use the docker-compose.dev.yml locally to test immediate changes.

```
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --force-recreate --build -d
```
